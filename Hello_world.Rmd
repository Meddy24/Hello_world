## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

library(gridExtra) # enables arranging multiple grid-based plots on a single page, combining multiple plots into a single plot, or arranging plots in a grid layout
library(knitr) #facilitates dynamic report generation in R, allowing you to mix R code with narrative text and generate reports in various formats such as HTML, PDF,
